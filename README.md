This is a line from RStudio

here is a line that was added at 6:08pm, Sunday September 14th 2014

here is a line that was edited in via github instead of rstudio and im gonna pull it into rstudio

hey it worked. also that first line when editing on github is the commit message, the box below is like an extension,

okay the last part of the homework is to report on what i've been doing so cool. all lines other than 10 and this one were pushed from rstudio. this line and line 10 were edited in github. after line 10 i tried to pull from github and it worked fine, i seem to be okay to do that whole 5 step workflow thing from the homework page. one thing i don't quite understand is what exactly does "commiting" do? i assume ctrl+s is saving changes to readme.md locally, and push is changing the document on github. commit just seems to be a prime for push? i guess im wondering what am i actually doing if i commit without pushing
